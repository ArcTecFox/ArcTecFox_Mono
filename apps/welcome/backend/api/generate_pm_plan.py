You are an expert in preventive maintenance (PM) for industrial assets. Generate a detailed preventive maintenance plan for the following asset.

Parent/Child Hierarchy & Universal Context (applies to all tasks unless overridden):

* Parent Asset: {data.parent_asset if data.parent_asset else "Not provided"}
* Child Asset: {data.child_asset if data.child_asset else "Not provided"}
* Site Location: {data.site_location if data.site_location else "Not provided"}
* Environment: {data.environment if data.environment else "Not provided"}
* Operating Hours: {data.hours}
* PM Frequency: {data.frequency}
* Criticality: {data.criticality}
* Additional Context: {data.additional_context}
* Plan Start Date: {today}

**Deduplication & Inheritance Rules (IMPORTANT):**

* Treat Site Location, Environment, Operating Hours, and Criticality as **universal** for this plan and **inherited by the child asset**. Do **not** repeat these in every field; only call out **deviations or overrides** at the task level.
* Avoid redundant phrasing across tasks. Keep fields concise and only include details unique to the task.
* If any universal field is unknown, proceed using best practices and state assumptions in the relevant task's "comments".

**Instructions:**

1. Organize tasks into the following standard frequency groups:

   * Daily
   * Weekly
   * Monthly
   * Quarterly
   * Yearly

2. For each task, provide **all** of the following fields. If a field is not applicable, explicitly return a value like "Not applicable". Do not omit fields. If a user has not provided enough input for a given field, reference the manufacturer's manual or reliable standards to determine an appropriate recommendation. If a manual is uploaded or accessible, reference it directly alongside any additional industry knowledge:

   * "parent_asset": The parent asset this task belongs to (inherit from universal context).
   * "child_asset": The specific child asset this task applies to (inherit from universal context).
   * "task_name": A clear, specific name for the maintenance task.
   * "maintenance_interval": One of the standard frequencies listed above.
   * "instructions": An array of clear, step-by-step instructions.
   * "reason": A short explanation of why this task is necessary.
   * "engineering_rationale": A technical explanation that references universal context **only when it changes or is directly relevant**. Explicitly call out when the task addresses something from the additional context: "{data.additional_context}".
   * "safety_precautions": Important safety measures or PPE required.
   * "common_failures_prevented": Typical failures this task helps avoid. Highlight known failure modes and grease points or wear-prone areas where relevant.
   * "usage_insights": Insights related to {data.hours}. Do **not** reference usage cycles.
   * "scheduled_dates": Array of dates for the next 12 months starting from {today}, based on task frequency.
   * "tools_needed": List of tools required to complete the task.
   * "number_of_technicians": How many technicians are typically needed.
   * "estimated_time_minutes": Estimated time in minutes to complete this task. This field must be included for every task.
   * "consumables": Supplies or parts that will be consumed in this task (single-use or limited-use). Be specific about **top recommendations** (brands, grades, part numbers). If not applicable, state "Not applicable".
   * "comments": Any additional notes, edge cases, or **explicit overrides** to the universal context (e.g., a task that must be done indoors despite an outdoor environment). If nothing to add, return "None".
   * "citations": Cite reliable sources‚Äîpreferably the manufacturer‚Äôs manual. If not available, use credible standards (ISO, ASTM, API) or supplier data (e.g., SKF, Mobil, Shell).
   * "inherits_parent_context": true/false indicating whether the task fully inherits the parent/child universal context.
   * "context_overrides": Object with only the fields that deviate from the universal context (e.g., {"environment": "Clean room"}). Use an empty object if none.

3. You must address all input provided in the "additional_context". If specific tasks are generated as a result, make that connection clear in "engineering_rationale" or "comments".

4. Prioritize information from the manufacturer‚Äôs manual. If not available, rely on best practices from industry standards and reputable sources.

**Output Format:**
Return a single valid JSON object structured like:
{{ "maintenance_plan": [ {{task1}}, {{task2}}, ... ] }}

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Return only the raw JSON object. Do not include markdown formatting, commentary, or extra text.
